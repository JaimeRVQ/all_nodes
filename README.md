## Folder structure example
Example of organization of a folder, that contains two libraries

| Folder structure                      | Classes representation                   | Scenes                                |
|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|

Each library can have as many modules as needed, and can have an 'icons' folder to provide icons for the classes contained in the modules.
